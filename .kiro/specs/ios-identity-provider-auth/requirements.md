# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a native iOS application that provides secure authentication through an identity provider. The app will present users with a login interface where they can enter their username and password credentials, which will then be validated against a configured identity provider (such as OAuth 2.0, SAML, or OpenID Connect). The application will handle the authentication flow, token management, and provide appropriate user feedback throughout the process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to enter my username and password in a native iOS app, so that I can authenticate with my organization's identity provider and access protected resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a login screen with username and password input fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate with the configured identity provider
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store authentication tokens securely in the iOS keychain
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
5. IF the user leaves credential fields empty THEN the system SHALL display validation messages before attempting authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my credentials and tokens to be handled securely, so that my authentication information is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are entered THEN the system SHALL transmit them over HTTPS only
2. WHEN authentication tokens are received THEN the system SHALL store them in the iOS keychain with appropriate access controls
3. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL obscure sensitive information on the screen
4. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic refresh if refresh tokens are available
5. IF biometric authentication is available THEN the system SHALL offer biometric login for subsequent sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about the authentication process, so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages (invalid credentials, network error, server error)
3. WHEN the network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate offline message
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL navigate to the main app interface
5. IF the identity provider is unreachable THEN the system SHALL display a service unavailable message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the app to work with different identity providers, so that it can be configured for various organizational authentication systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is configured THEN the system SHALL support OAuth 2.0 authentication flows
2. WHEN the app is configured THEN the system SHALL support OpenID Connect authentication
3. WHEN identity provider endpoints are configured THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration at startup
4. WHEN multiple identity providers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow users to select their provider
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display configuration error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want the app to remember my authentication state, so that I don't have to log in every time I use the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is reopened within the token validity period THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate the user
2. WHEN tokens are valid THEN the system SHALL skip the login screen and go directly to the main interface
3. WHEN the user explicitly logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication data
4. WHEN tokens expire and cannot be refreshed THEN the system SHALL return to the login screen
5. IF the app is uninstalled and reinstalled THEN the system SHALL require fresh authentication
